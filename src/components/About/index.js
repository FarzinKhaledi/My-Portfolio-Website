            I'm a very ambitious full stack web developer looking for a role in
            an established IT company with the opportunity to work with the
            latest technologies on challenging and diverse projects.
          </p>
          <p align="LEFT">
            I am genuinely passionate about self-development and continuous
            improvement, this is demonstrated by my determination to commit to
            learning numerous skills in a variety of areas including software
            development, sales, online marketing, and investing in further
            education. My goal is to provide significant value for those I work
            for. I'm quiet confident, naturally curious, and perpetually working
            on improving my chops one design and development problem at a time.
          </p>
          <p>
            I consider myself someone who is self-motivated, punctual,
            conscientious, and importantly determined to see success. I enjoy
            learning and I am not afraid to make mistakes, indeed I value the
            opportunity to improve myself through experiences in life both
            personally and professionally. My top three values are continuous
            improvement, contribution, and seeing people succeed in life.
            tech-obsessed!!!
